One of the additional features I did was a life counter, wave counter, and score
counter at the top of the screen. I did this by creating hidden attributes in 
the wave class which increased when necessairy. I then passed these values over 
to the Invaders class so that they could be put on GLabels and displayed to the 
player.The players lives are also saved, so they do not reset inbetween waves. 
Once the player loses all of their lives, I made it so they could press 's' to 
play again. When they play a new game, the values for lives, wave number, and 
score are all reset to their initial values.

I also mmade it so that there are multiple waves, and for each new wave the 
aliens move faster. I did this by making a _speed attribute, which increased 
each time the player started a new wave. I kept track of the player was on in a 
hidden attribut _currentWave.
